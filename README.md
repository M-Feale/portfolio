# Portfolio

My portfolio is, as the name suggests, a web page showcasing my skills and interests as an upcoming full-stack web developer. 
It is created with React and Vite and consists of solely a front-end (as of July 2023).

## Guidelines

The User Story that was given to us was from the point of view of a potential employer or client and was articulated around 4 major components:
1. Easy navigation and showcasing of our work and skills.
2. Clean, professional design and a reflection of our personal brand.
3. Offer a easy point of contact for further communication.
4. Being accessible through different devices.

## Thought Process 

Starting a project from scratch can be a daunting endeavour, especially when it’s as personal as a portfolio. That’s why before launching myself in VS Code, I layed out a plan for my project, dividing it into two broad sections: Design and Implementation. It’s important to note that throughout my portfolio journey, I documented every steps, features, problems and ideas I had and made a bullet-list recap of my work at the end of every day.

### Design

I spent the first hours of my project looking for inspirations through other portfolios available online but also for the palette and general feel I wanted my project to convey.


As I really love Hayao Miyazaki movies, I looked through palettes matching his works like *My Neighbor Totoro*, *Kiki’s Delivery Service*, *Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind* and *Spirited Away*.

Then, I researched design fundamentals to get up to speed with the best practices around choosing colors and fonts.

Finally, I spent some time brainstorming to refine my brand and its message. I narrowed down my design choices and tried a few of them on the page with a Banner and a Home component. I limited my design choices further to only 3 fonts and 3 colors that I would use wisely throughout my portfolio (in accordance with the design principles I had researched) and once that was done, I knew where I was going with the visual identity of my website.

### Implementation

While looking for visual inspiration through other portfolios, I also made notes of the features that I liked and the structure each website had. I doodled layouts in my notebook and was able to narrow down what would work and please my personal taste.
That allowed me to plan ahead the coding structure of my own portfolio which jump-started my division of each feature into a React Component.

Afterwards, I looked again through the provided requirements for the project and highlighted the different sections I needed to implement for my minimal viable product (MVP). I also took note of my personal bonus requirements for the project, features I absolutely wanted to add which were an animated landing page and a cohesive design and visual identity.

What was left to do was to start coding!

I started by quickly putting together a first version of a Banner and Home component to test out fonts and colors in and then made my way through the MVP requirement list one component at a time.

## Disclaimer

This project is completed in its first iteration but is also a work in progress. I have many more ideas for new features, a better user experience and a lengthier showcase of my past projects. All that to say, visit my portfolio often, there will be new things for you to see !
